        <p>The Aries year horoscope is all about dusting yourself off and getting back into life’s ring. If you’ve felt jaded by life recently, this year is going to bring redemption to any parts of your heart that you’re ready to mend. Use 2022 to release old belief systems and finally see the world as a blank canvas. You are not the things that have happened to you—you are a being worthy of love and abundance beyond your wildest dreams. Start by dedicating yourself to passion projects and people who light your soul on fire. </p>
        <p>You may start to find that it’s easier to spend your time alone than surrounded by the wrong company this year. That realization alone will make you realize how special the people who you do align with are. Do not take your life for granted any longer. Share with the people you love through gift giving and words of affirmation in 2022. You are on the right path, but gratitude will get you to your goals much more quickly, Aries.

        <p>Twenty twenty-two is sure to be a transformative year with the nodal shift and eclipse season occupying your sign throughout the year, Taurus. If you’ve been sitting in the background of your own life, this will be the year when your position finally changes and you start to see yourself as the main character that you always have been! Expect the unexpected when it comes to love, whether this is a surprise upgrade or completion of your existing relationship. </p>
        <p>And for my single Taurus friends: You will be pleasantly surprised with the options you’ll have in the year ahead. There is nothing that can get in your way, besides yourself. So step out of self-doubt and start to truly believe in the power you hold. Then, and only then, will you see your life transform from stagnant to stellar.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="gemini">
        <img src="img/gemini.jpg">
        <p>Ah, my twins! This year will ask you to create a new level of stability and balance in your life. With the nodal axis shifting from you and your sister sign (Gemini and Sagittarius) to the current occupying signs of Taurus and Scorpio, there will be less activation and triggering in the air for my Gems. Try to invite yourself to find comfort in the quiet. You could be slowing down on travel, responsibilities, obligatory relationships, and chaos into a much simpler lifestyle. Your nervous system will surely thank you!</p>
        <p>When it comes to love, make sure you’re investing in the right people for the right reasons. Don’t keep someone around just to fill a void. Instead, get comfortable with your own company—whether you’re in a relationship or not. A healthy partner will admire your dedication to yourself, so make this a top priority in 2022. I see retreats, meditation, and emotional support systems through community and therapeutic techniques. Don’t give up on the life you see for yourself.</p>

      <div id="cancer">
        <img src="img/cancer.jpg">
        <p>Cancers, this year is going to be full of social events and opportunities for you to connect deeply with others. Make sure that you’re taking proper care of your mental and emotional health along the way and that you're giving yourself permission to intertwine rest into your daily experience, rather than waiting until you’re burnt out!
        </p>
        <p>For my single Cancers, this year illuminates a clear path to connect with a soulmate. Ask yourself whether you’re looking for noncommittal fun or dedication and longevity. Either path is yours once you choose what works best for you! There is no right or wrong answer, simply an authentic choice. Once you release the dogmatic thought process of living life “right” or “wrong,” you will find that there was only ever “authentic” and “inauthentic.” Set yourself free of mental rigidity in 2022.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="leo">
        <img src="img/leo.jpg">
        <p>Dearest Leos, what a time to be alive! This year is sure to be full of joy and celebration for you—and you are reliably ready to soak up life’s pleasures. However, the question this year is: Can you start to weather the storms of difficulty with that same willingness? You are sure to be surrounded by love, success, and good fortune this year. But your task will be to find the gray space—somewhere between being swept up by difficult moments or disengaging all together.</p>
        <p>The lesson is to find peace in the midst of chaos. And Leo, we’ve never known you to shy away from a challenge! Your love life will prosper if you can dedicate rather than run; if you’re single, this will be the year to find a lion or lioness that can rule the animal kingdom alongside you. If you’re already coupled, expect some surprises in your love story. Let go of the timeline you had for how your life was “meant” to pan out, and start to see the beauty in life’s uncontrollable unfolding. You will benefit most in the moments when you choose to surrender.

      <div id="virgo">
        <img src="img/virgo.jpg">
        <p>Twenty twenty-two is about to be a year of deep transformational change, Virgo. No more self-doubt—you are ready for this! Expect your limitations to be lifted as life takes you higher and asks you to expand now more than ever. Whether you’ve been stagnant in love, professional life, finances, your living space, or your friend circle—discontent will be a thing of the past.</p>
        <p>You are about to be blessed with expansion and ascension, and I see many of you stepping into the limelight with your career. There will be an opening for you to bring your passion projects to life, and no one will be able to get in the way of your imminent success. Start to get comfortable with your wants and needs by setting strong boundaries around your precious time, and ultimately start to view your energetic well-being as a top priority. The term “power couple” is coming through strongly. So whether you are single or currently coupled, stand by for a leveling-up in your love life as well. May 2022 be your best year yet, Virgo.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="libra">
        <img src="img/libra.jpg">
        <p>My dearest Libra, 2022 for you will be a year of releasing guilt, shame, and self-deprecation. You are finally in a place where you can see how much of an obstacle your nagging thoughts can be, and will finally be ready to leave this behavior in the past. Treat this year as an opportunity for you to get to know yourself on a deeper and more intimate level than ever before. Start to become comfortable with journaling, recording voice notes of your thoughts to listen back to, or maybe try out mirror work (i.e., telling yourself how beautiful and truly special you are as you get ready in the morning). Allow your fear of loving yourself to dissolve. </p>
        <p>Reminder: You are more than your outer shell, and you will start to discover parts of yourself that had remained unseen this year. I see creative hobbies being a pivotal part of 2022 for you. Break out the easel, sit yourself down on a pottery wheel, or start collecting fun thread and beads to make BFF bracelets for your closest friends. There is no limit to how lovely your life can be, and once you allow yourself to enjoy your own existence, every other aspect of your life will begin to flourish.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="scorpio">
        <img src="img/scorpio.jpg">
        <p>Scorpios, this year you are about to embark on a journey that wipes away all of the pain and misfortune that you’ve dealt with in the past. I sense that there are ex-lovers and old friends who need their access to your energy revoked. If you allow just about anyone and everyone to have access to your time, money, and energy…where will you be left? Depleted and frustrated. You cannot expect people to treat you differently from the way you allow them to. This will be a year of raising your cost of admission.</p>
        <p>I see a career upheaval happening for you this year that will change your life (and lifestyle!). Do not settle for less than what you deserve. You may also enter into a partnership with someone who assists you in building your business and confidence. This is the bare minimum for you now as you continue to rise. Remember, if you have to perform for someone to see your worth, they were never worthy of your light to begin with.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="sagittarius">
        <img src="img/sagittarius.jpg">
        <p>Happy New Year, centaurs! Twenty twenty-two is arriving for you to embrace rest and relaxation after the last year and a half of illumination and activation from the Gemini-Sagittarius axis. We are now transitioning into the Taurus-Scorpio axis, which will call for you to root, release, and rehabilitate. Your spirit has been calling out to you for a while to revisit your childhood dreams and desires.</p>
        <p>You were never meant to be a cog in the machine, and this will be the year for you to step outside of your daily routine and find new ways of enjoying the life that you’ve been gifted. Life does not need to be flashy in order to be fun. Stopping to smell the roses, breathing a bit more deeply, giving yourself permission to take a few days off work, and making your coffee with a pinch more sweetness won’t hurt anyone. Your love life is about to become mellow in a truly beautiful way. If you can find more work-life balance, your personal relationships will begin to thrive. Stay present to the ones you love while you have time with them. When you make an effort to sit in gratitude each day that you wake up and have a new chance, the universe will bless you for your thankful approach. I see a lot of you working smarter, not harder—actually earning more and laboring less. Believe in that reality, it’s already happening!</p>

      <div id="capricorn">
        <img src="img/capricorn.jpg">
        <p>My dear sea goats, 2022 for you is about to trigger a moment of release. You may have been caught up in grief, resentment, or grudges for things that happened in the past. I see you gaining new perspective on your life this year and taking yourself off the hamster wheel of feeling, thinking, and behaving in the same ways you have for years. If you are willing to take accountability to how you’ve held yourself back from receiving the blessings that you desire, you will be gifted with good fortune beyond your wildest dreams.</p>
        <p>Start to step outside your comfort zone. For some of you I see performance (theater, improv, content creation, live music, poetry readings, or sharing your art more publicly). You are a gift to this earth, and once you start treating yourself more kindly and with more support, I see it being easier for you to accept support and kindness from others. Expect your collaborations and close relationships to bloom in 2022 from your newfound open-heartedness.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="aquarius">
        <img src="img/aquarius.jpg">
        <p>My unique and curious Aquarians, this year is going to be filled with opportunities for you to change the narrative that other people have about the meaning of life. You may be writing, or sharing, parts of your story that help other people to feel more safe to open up themselves. If you are able to reflect and share your experiences with empowerment, you can expect to turn your mess into your message in 2022.</p>
        <p>I see you being in a great space with the community you have chosen to surround yourself with. Expect this to expand in the new year, welcoming even more pure-hearted people into your heart. There are soul connections you have yet to make, and memories you’ve yet to experience. Don’t get too caught up in where you are with your career, your love life, and your personal progression. This year is about to blow your mind in the best of ways with what you have in store! Use the pressure to turn your life into a diamond-encrusted masterpiece.</p>
      </div>
      <div id="pisces">
        <img src="img/pisces.jpg">
        <p>Pisces, you are about to embark on a journey of self-discovery, and rather than finding the answer in rigid study and self-help books, you are waking up to the lessons found in moments of joy. Letting yourself savor your life a bit more will be the exact remedy your heart has been asking for all these years. Life does not need to feel loveless, love does not need to feel like work, and work does not need to consume your life. You will find many opportunities this year to remind yourself of how far you have come.</p>
        <p>I encourage you to stay wildly optimistic about where you are headed. If you are entering into the new year single, in your love horoscope I see an opportunity for sweet and pure-natured love arriving to you in 2022. And for my already coupled Pisces, start to take opportunities to be more open and honest with your current partner. Let yourself step into true vulnerability this year to remind yourself: You are safe to open up to life and all of its endless possibilities! Opening your heart will lead you to joy and success that at one point you could have only ever dreamed of.</p>
